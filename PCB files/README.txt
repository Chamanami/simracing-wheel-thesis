This directory contains the PCB design files created in KiCad, including the schematics,
board layout, and component libraries. 

The custom PCB is designed to provide mounting points for components such as buttons
and rotary encoders. It also includes space for the MCU board, the custom display module,
and connectors to establish the connection with the PC.
